I will be the first to admit I'm a bit behind the times. Having worked in a context where every piece of software you use is heavily scrutinized, I haven't had much exposure to genAI since I started working for the government. 

Recently I started thinking about employment beyond these confines, for obvious reasons. And so I've been using genAI a bit, mostly on free plans. I've tried out the major chat interfaces, and settled on a Pro account for the next month with Antrophic. Why Anthropic and Claude? Well, it was the most enjoyable to use, they aren't a FAANG, and I am the most convinced by their philosophy on [safety](https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/8106465-our-approach-to-user-safety). 

I am not an AI skeptic, and I am not an evangelist. I am curious. With that said, I have really been enjoying talking to Claude about a range of things. After chatting for a while about some technology and sociio-technical related topics, I tried to use Claude to build something. It was very enjoyable! Claude did get quite a few things wrong, or wrong enough that they would've lead to problems down the road. Having built things before I felt I already had opinions and knew what to ask, but overall I had a lot of fun.
