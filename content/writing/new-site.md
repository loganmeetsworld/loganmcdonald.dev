I used to write a lot on the internet. Most of it is gone now. Around five years ago I decided to stop being much of a poster, and turn consumer. Some of that content is archived I'm sure, but most is lost to me. Lately, I've been pushed more out of my shell and have been wanting to express myself more. I say pushed because I probbaly would've been content to stay in it. I have a great job, a wonderful family, and better things to do than post on the internet. The last five years I've been focussed on those things, rather than engaging with the wider world.

I've thrown together this new site because I want to hold space for my thoughts. These times call for more engagement. I want to share what I've been working on, and thoughts on a way to move forward. Thank you for following along.
