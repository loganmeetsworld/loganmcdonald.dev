I'm Logan. I am currently a Principal Consulting Software Engineer with [18F](18f.gov), a U.S. federal agency that advizes people in other agencies and local governments on building human-centered and resilient technology. I previously worked as a Staff Engineer in the private sector at companies like BuzzFeed and Kickstarter, where I concentrated on systems operability, safety, and release engineering. Here you can find musings about technology and work. In my non-work time I love to challenge myself with long-distance running, cooking, and learning new things. Some writing related to that may pop up from time to time!
