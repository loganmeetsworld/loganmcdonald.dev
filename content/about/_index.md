I'm Logan. I am currently an expert consultant providing advice on reliability and software development to the federal government, specifically with Federal Student Aid at the Department of Education. I have extensive experience in teaching human centered design, software engineering practices, and safety to federal agencies as an engineering leader at [18F](18f.org). I have also worked as a Staff Engineer in the private sector at companies like BuzzFeed and Kickstarter, where I concentrated on systems operability, safety, and release engineering. Here you can find musings about technology and work. In my non-work time I love to challenge myself with long-distance running, cooking, and learning new things. Some writing related to that may pop up from time to time!
