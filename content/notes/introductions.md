Who am I? I'm a software engineer with over a decade of experience. For the last four years I have had the honor of being a civil servant at 18F, which is part of the General Services Administration. 

The work I do is best catagorized as bueaucracy wrangling. I try to navigate large systems to get work done, and hope that in the end that work is a great ROI for taxpayers. As a taxpayer myself, I certainly think so. Our organization has a great influence far beyond the confines of 1800 F St. in Washington, D.C. Our [guides](https://18f.gsa.gov/guides/) are referenced by digital services across the U.S. and even globally. 

Beyond my technical work, I lead teams. The problems I enjoy most are strategic in nature. I love constraint satisfaction problems. At the end of the day there are problems to solve, and many ways to get to delivery. I take pride in simple solutions to these kinds of problems, and enjoy mentoring and facilitating team success. 

In my personal life, I love running and being outdoors. My biggest goal is to enable the people around me to be their happiest and fullest selves. This is the energy I bring to The Work, both in a salaried role and throughout my interactions.
