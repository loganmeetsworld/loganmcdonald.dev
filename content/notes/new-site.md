Welcome to my new site! I had a lot of fun making it and I hope that I can keep up with writing more in the new year (it's early 2025 at time of writing). I have chosen not to port over my old writings and just start new. Lately, I've been pushed out of my shell and have been wanting to express myself more. I say pushed because I probbaly would've been content to stay in it. I have a great job, a wonderful family, and better things to do than post on the internet. The last five years I've been focussed on those internal things, rather than engaging with the wider world.

I've thrown together this new site because I want to hold space for my thoughts for the forseeable future. These times call for more engagement. I want to share what I've been working on, and thoughts on a way to move forward. Thank you for following along.
